        backer to rug pool communities. Pirate Treasure is for the community,
        minted by you as you click. If any value arises from Pirate Treasure it
        is you the Minter and user who has created such value, and it is by your
        decision as a community of users that such value may change, vanish,
        accumulate or never exist.
